LinearRegression1 contains math computation for:
  1. SST = total sum of squared;
  2. SSE = sum of Squared Errors;
  3. MSE = mean squared error;
  4. R2 = the coefficient of determination for goodness of fit of the regression;
  5. Average = mean of the elements of an array;
  6. Main method: where we just test the above computations.
